# MangaWeb
## Introduction
This project is credited to *Web Dev Simplified*.   
Through this project, I learned how to build a website using a database, in thise case, the MongoDB. More importantly, I had a better sense of how full stack web development works. I also did some small animation exersies while building this web.  

**MangaWeb functions as a manga library. Visitors can search interesting mangas and add their favorite mangas as well.**   
Welcome to explore the manga world!
